                <p className={`${styles.paragraph}`}> The Eagles made sure to mention that
                    field conditions didn't decide the game. (It's not like we were playing on ice and they were playing on
                    grass; we all had to play on it, Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni said.) But it affected both teams. The
                    Eagles had 70 sacks in the regular season and none Sunday. There were factors that went into that, such
                    as the Chiefs using a quick passing game. But the field conditions probably slowed down the Eagles pass
                    rushers a bit.It was hard. I beat my man a couple times, trying to turn the corner and just was
                    slipping, Reddick said. It was very disappointing. It’s the NFL, you’d think it would be better so we
                    can get some better play. But it is what it is. Reddick said he didn't want to use the turf as an
                    excuse. He said the Chiefs deserved to win. But it was clearly a point of frustration. Maybe the league
                    can look at it and tell Arizona they’ve got to step their stuff up,Reddick said. I don’t know. It’s not
                    my decision to make, it’s not my call to make.</p>
